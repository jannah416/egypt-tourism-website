      Luxor city is mainly located on the two banks of the Nile, south Egypt.
      The city has important historical significance for being the capital of
      ancient Egypt during the 16thâ€“11th centuries B.C after the old capital of
      Memphis. Enjoy Luxor day tours, Luxor was called "Thebes" and was divided
      by the Nile banks. In the East bank, priests believed it was for
      worshipping gods and devoting sanctuary temples for deities. Luxor day
      tours on the East bank include all the worshipping temples that were
      dedicated to Amun Ra', God of the sun. While the ancient Egyptians and

      took place. Luxor day tours will introduce you both to the West and East
